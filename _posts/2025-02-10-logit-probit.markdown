Predicting a binary y: probability prediction and classification
With a binary y variable, we can make two kinds of predictions:
1. Probability prediction: predicting the probability of y = 1 for each observation,
yˆ
P, which is the shorthand notation for Pb[y = 1 | x],
2. Classification: predicting whether yˆ = 0 or yˆ = 1 for each observation.
