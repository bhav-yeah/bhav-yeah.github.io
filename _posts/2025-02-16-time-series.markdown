How to choose the best values for p and q when building ARMA models?


âœ… Use ACF/PACF for an initial guess of p and q.
âœ… Use BIC(Bayesian Information Criterion)/AICc(Corrected Akaike Information Criterion) for better model selection.
âœ… Cross-validation is possible but complex due to ordering constraints.
âœ… Train-test split is the most reliable approach in practice.

ARIMA: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models extend ARMA models to handle non-stationary time series.
